# Files_Basics
This Activity shows a simple copy and paste procedure. 
The user may specify a file name from the DCIM/Camera folder and see the jpeg-image being read into
the programme, turned into a Bitmap, reduced to a thumbnail and written back to /DCIM/Test folder together 
with a new 'thumb' infix. In addition it includes a permission request procedure as suggested by developer.android.com.
